# flyExclusive-Data-Challenge

This repository includes a jupyter notebook containing the analysis for this data challenge.

## Scenario: 

You’ve been hired as a data scientist for MMC Direct, a medical motorcycle courier company. MMC prides itself on providing safe and efficient deliveries of important medical items (including lab specimens, medications, and transplant organs) between labs and hospitals throughout the North Carolina Piedmont region. 


The company uses motorcycles for efficiency and ease of travel, but this means that couriers can only transport one package at a time. Requests are received from clients at least 24 hours in advance, so demand is known the day before and routes are scheduled at the start of the day. 


The company started with little technology—routing was originally done on paper each morning. However, this has become very time-consuming with company growth. The company is now exploring automated scheduling and routing to dispatch couriers.

The executive team’s current question is: can an automated system improve our operations? Travel timing is important for sample vitality—minutes matter. Additionally, the executive team believes that the fleet is underutilized, with empty legs and down-time between deliveries. 

## Exercise: 

We'd like you to create a reproducible analysis with the given data to help answer one of these questions (choose your own adventure):

- How efficient is the recent routing or where are the inefficiencies?
- How much could MMC improve efficiency?
- How many requests could MMC serve with the current courier fleet?
- A question of your choosing after exploring the data.

The Request data includes actual pickup and delivery times for legs between client locations plus the expected delivery times for incomplete/upcoming requests. The Fleet data includes upcoming availability for the courier team. The Client data includes information about client locations.  

Please write your code in Python or R, put your code to a Github (or Gitlab) repository, and send me the link. Then, we will schedule a follow-up video call that will include time for you to share your analysis with some teammates.

Prioritize answering one question over covering multiple parts. You will be assessed based on your coding, problem solving, and communication skills (not on your ability to fully address the question).
